# Collaborative Browser Project - Detailed Conversation Summary

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a **shared, collaborative browser-like experience** that runs entirely within a single webpage. Users can create/join rooms via shareable links and experience synchronized browsing where everyone sees the same page, including videos, scrolling, and navigation.

### Core Requirements
- **Public web accessibility**: No installations or extensions required
- **Room-based collaboration**: Create/join rooms with shareable links
- **Synchronized browsing**: When one user navigates, everyone sees the same content
- **Real browser experience**: Full interactivity (forms, buttons, navigation)
- **No iframe limitations**: Must work with sites like YouTube that block iframe embedding
- **Multi-user support**: Shared tabs, bookmarks, and role-swapping capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Microservices Architecture
The solution is built as three separate services:

1. **Frontend Client** (Next.js/React/TypeScript)
   - Port: 3000 (or 3003 if 3000 is occupied)
   - Location: `/src/components/CollaborativeBrowser.tsx`
   - Handles user interface, room management, and browser display

2. **Signaling Server** (Node.js/Express/Socket.IO)
   - Port: 3001
   - Location: `/server/src/`
   - Manages WebSocket connections, room creation/joining, and real-time event broadcasting

3. **Browser Service** (Node.js/Express)
   - Port: 3002
   - Location: `/browser-service/src/`
   - Controls headless browser instances and provides screenshots/content

### Browser Automation Strategy
To overcome iframe limitations, the system uses **headless browser automation**:
- **Primary**: Playwright (preferred for stability)
- **Fallback**: Puppeteer (alternative headless browser)
- **Last Resort**: HTTP client (axios) with mock responses
- **Content Delivery**: Real-time screenshots streamed to clients

## Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Iframe Blocking (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: User explicitly rejected iframes due to `X-Frame-Options` blocking on sites like YouTube
**Solution**: Implemented server-side headless browser with screenshot streaming
**Implementation**: Browser service takes screenshots and serves them via HTTP endpoints

### Challenge 2: Direct neko Usage Rejection (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: User rejected direct usage of m1k1o/neko project
**Solution**: Studied neko's architecture but built completely original implementation
**Outcome**: Custom microservices architecture with separate signaling, browser, and client services

### Challenge 3: Headless Browser Stability (ONGOING)
**Problem**: Persistent failures with Puppeteer and Playwright initialization
**Symptoms**:
- `Error: Navigating frame was detached`
- `socket hang up (ECONNRESET)`
- `browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist`
- `page.goto: net::ERR_ABORTED`

**Current Status**: System falls back to mock browser when real browser fails
**Mitigation**: Robust error handling with graceful fallback to mock responses

### Challenge 4: Service Connectivity Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: Initial issues with services not starting properly
**Solution**: Created comprehensive startup script and improved error handling
**Result**: All services now start reliably with proper process management

## Key Components Analysis

### Frontend Client (`src/components/CollaborativeBrowser.tsx`)
**Features**:
- WebSocket connection to signaling server
- Room creation and joining logic
- Browser URL navigation interface
- Screenshot display from browser service
- Real-time connection status monitoring

**Key Functions**:
- `createRoom()`: Creates new collaborative rooms
- `joinRoom()`: Joins existing rooms via room ID
- `navigateToUrl()`: Sends navigation commands to browser service
- `refreshBrowserImage()`: Updates browser screenshot display

### Browser Service (`browser-service/src/index.ts`)
**Core Functionality**:
- Headless browser management (Playwright ‚Üí Puppeteer ‚Üí axios fallback)
- Screenshot generation and serving
- URL navigation handling
- Content fetching for fallback scenarios

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /screenshot`: Returns PNG screenshot of current browser state
- `POST /navigate`: Navigates browser to specified URL
- `GET /content`: Returns HTML content (fallback mode)

**Browser Initialization Logic**:
```typescript
// Priority: Playwright ‚Üí Puppeteer ‚Üí HTTP Client ‚Üí Mock
try {
  // Attempt Playwright
  const playwright = require('playwright');
  browser = await playwright.chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  // ... success handling
} catch {
  // Attempt Puppeteer
  const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
  browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: 'new' });
  // ... success handling
} catch {
  // Fallback to HTTP client
  const axios = require('axios');
  // ... mock implementation
}
```

### Signaling Server (`server/src/`)
**Purpose**: Real-time communication hub
**Technologies**: Socket.IO, Express
**Features**:
- Room management (creation, joining, user tracking)
- Event broadcasting (navigation, user actions)
- Connection handling and error recovery

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: All three services implemented and communicating
- **Room Management**: Create/join rooms with WebSocket signaling
- **Browser Interface**: Functional UI with address bar and navigation
- **Screenshot Streaming**: Real-time browser screenshot delivery
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms
- **Process Management**: Reliable service startup and monitoring

### üîÑ Partially Working
- **Headless Browser**: Initializes successfully but experiences runtime failures
- **Real Browser Content**: Falls back to mock when browser automation fails
- **Navigation**: URL input works but may not reflect real browser state

### ‚ùå Known Issues
- **Browser Stability**: Frequent crashes and socket disconnections
- **Content Synchronization**: Mock fallback doesn't provide real interactivity
- **Performance**: Screenshot-based approach may have latency issues

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Architecture Design
- Analyzed neko project for inspiration
- Designed microservices architecture
- Set up project structure with Next.js, Node.js services

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
